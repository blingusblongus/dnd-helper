# BlingusDnD

Tbh, this project is mostly just to practice auth and backend dev - but maybe it'll turn into something...I do find most current virtual DnD sheets to be a little annoying to use.

Here are some of the goals:

Initial/Basics:

-   [ ] Standard Automatic level-up
-   [ ] Automatic Rolls for Weapon/Skill Checks
-   [ ] Collapsible/hoverable/toggleable or otherwise arrangeable sections for most things - this is what annoys me most about using spreadsheets or other solutions, as it's so easy to either get overwhelmed with text, or skip important info that you need to look up later.

Maybe even:

-   [ ] Integration with existing DnD APIs for items/skills
-   [ ] DM/Player tools, like:
    -   [ ] Parties, allowing characters to be shared with a DM.
    -   [ ] Initiative or AC trackers.
    -   [ ] Party-based probabilities, to help DMs set appropriate skill checks, etc.
-   [ ] Character Images
